Lubricate bondtech gears
  Super Lube grease on synchro gears and needle bearings

## Linear Rods
1. Wipe the rod clean
2. Using a tooth pick apply a little Super Lube Grease
3. Using a lint free cloth spread the grease on the rod so it isn't built up
4. Run the linear bearing over the rod to get the grease into the bearings

## Lead Screws
