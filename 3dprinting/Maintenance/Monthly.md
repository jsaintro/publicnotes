## Extruder gears (Bondtech)
1. Apply Super lube to drive gears (Not part that grips filament
2. Remove the idler part and lube the needle bearing with Super Lube

## Linear Rods
1. Wipe the rod clean
2. Using a tooth pick apply a little Super Lube Grease
3. Using a lint free cloth spread the grease on the rod so it doesn't built up
4. Run the linear bearing over the rod to get the grease into the bearings

## Lead Screws
Same as `Linear Rods` process

## Grease
Use Super Lube Multi-Purpose Synthetic Grease with Syncolon (PTFE)
This is available at Logan hardware in a 3 oz tube (You keep it with the glues in the workshop)
