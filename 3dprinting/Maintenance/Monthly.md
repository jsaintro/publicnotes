## Extruder gears (Bondtech)
1. Apply Super lube to drive gears (Not part that grips filament
2. Remove the idler part and lube the needle bearing with Super Lube

## Linear Rods
1. Wipe the rod clean
2. Using a tooth pick apply a little Super Lube Grease
3. Using a lint free cloth spread the grease on the rod so it doesn't built up
4. Run the linear bearing over the rod to get the grease into the bearings

## Lead Screws
Same as `Linear Rods` process
Use a toothbrush to get in between grooves
traverse lead screws up and down while scrubbing with toothbrush to get all sides of lead screws
wrap lead screw with lint free cloth below brushing to prevent debris from falling into nut or stepper motors.

## Grease
Use Super Lube Multi-Purpose Synthetic Grease with Syncolon (PTFE)
This is available at Logan hardware in a 3 oz tube (You keep it with the glues in the workshop)
