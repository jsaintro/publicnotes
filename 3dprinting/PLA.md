# PLA
## Radio Shack Blue
* Bed Temp 80 Trying 70
* Hotend temp 220 (Yup that's right Blue PLA needs this, otherwise it'll skip)
* Normal Resolution .2
* Max Resolution (Nozzle diameter .4) is .1??
* Don't use fan accept for bridging??
* Fan 100% wne Bridging and when layer less than 15s??
* disable slowdown for small layers??
* Overhangs tend to curl a lot easier maybe use supports (Probably need fan for this)
## Experiments
Run fan at 60% starting 2nd layer
