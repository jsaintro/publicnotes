# PLA
## Radio Shack Blue
* Bed Temp 80 Trying 70
* Hotend temp 220 (Yup that's right Blue PLA needs this, otherwise it'll skip) Note still skipping occaisionally so increate 5 degrees)
* Normal Resolution .2
* Max Resolution (Nozzle diameter .4) is .1??
* Always use fan 100%
* disable slowdown for small layers??
* Overhangs tend to curl a lot easier maybe use supports (Reducing bed temp to 60 degrees) also probably need more efficient part cooling duct.
## Experiments
Run fan at 60% starting 2nd layer

## Drying out

## **How to dry 3D printing filament:**

1) Preheat your oven to 160-180°F (or 70-80°C). Tried 175 Next time do 160 for PLA

2) Place spool in oven for 4-6 hours Tried 5.5 hrs

3) Remove and place in an airtight container, preferably with desiccant. 5-gallon buckets with airtight lids from local hardware stores work very well for filament storage. You can use uncooked rice as a cheap desiccant.

Filaments with lower glass transition temperatures (Tg) like PLA, use lower temperatures to dry. Lower temperatures also require more time to thoroughly dry.

That’s really all that’s necessary to dry out your filament and ensure optimum material performance and surface finish.

So if you have some spools that have been sitting out for a while and aren’t printing as well as they used to, dry them out and try again. Chances are they’ll be like new.  
  
As always, Happy Printing!
