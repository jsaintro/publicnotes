# PLA
## Radio Shack Blue
* Bed Temp 80 Trying 70
* Hotend temp 220 (Yup that's right Blue PLA needs this, otherwise it'll skip) Note still skipping occaisionally so increate 5 degrees)
* Normal Resolution .2
* Max Resolution (Nozzle diameter .4) is .1??
* Always use fan 100%
* disable slowdown for small layers??
* Overhangs tend to curl a lot easier maybe use supports (Reducing bed temp to 60 degrees)
## Experiments
Run fan at 60% starting 2nd layer
