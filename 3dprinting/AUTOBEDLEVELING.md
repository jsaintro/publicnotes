# Servo Wiring
## Wiring color codes
* Signal = Orange/Yellow
* Positive = Red
* Negative = Brown/Black
## Cat 5e recommendations
Given 24 Guage Stranded
* 24 Guage is fine for each wire
* Signal = one wire or pair (Just so we don't have a loose wire)
* Positive + Nagative = one pair 
# Switch
## Switch Wiring
* Gugage isn't important
* use a pair
