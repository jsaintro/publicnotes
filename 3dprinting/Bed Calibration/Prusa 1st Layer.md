# Prusa 1st Layer Calibration
1. Determine temperatures
	PLA 65C for Bed and 220 for extruder
	ABS 110C for Bed and 255 for extruder
	Note: for ABS you'll have to manually set temperatures as automatic process is only good for PLA
2. Start calibration procedure
	Menu/Calibration/First layer cal.
3. Manually tune temperatures from step one
    Tune/Bed Temp, Tune/Hotend Temp

	Knob
	 CCW is down, smaller number is closer
	 CW is up, larger number is up
