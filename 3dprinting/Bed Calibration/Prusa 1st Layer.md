1. Determine temperatures
	PLA 70C for Bed and 220 for extruder
	ABS 105 for Bed and 255 for extruder
	Note: for ABS you'll have to manually set temperatures as automatic process is only good for PLA
2. Start calibration procedure
	Menu/Calibration/First layer cal.
3. Manually tune temperatures from step one
    Tune/Bed Temp, Tune/Hotend Temp


Knob
 CCW is down
 CW is up

Temp for PLA is 3 Deg lower than what is reported
For RS Red PLAtry 65 for bed and 215 for extruder
Success with Bed 70 and Nozzle 220
