Requirements = What does it need to do?

Functional requirements = What must it do?
	The system must do...
	  heat meals in space-packaging
	  allow user to set time for meal to be ready
	  notify user when meal is ready via space-pager
	  change cooking time based on type of meal
	  continue to function without network connection
	  

Non-Functional requirements = how should it do it?
  Don't worry about having it ready for everything (Think MVP)
  The system should be ...
	  available 24/7
	  usable while wearing work gloves

  Examples : legal, performance, support, security
