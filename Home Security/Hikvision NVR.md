[https://us.hikvision.com/en/support-resources/firmware](https://us.hikvision.com/en/support-resources/firmware)
Select DS-7608NI-E2/8P
Installed FW is 3.4.96 Probably the last rev
Put on USB Key
Backup config
update
USB KEY needs to formatted Fat32 to be read.  a Ubuntu boot disk seems to work

## Camera updates
ALL CAMERAS are COMPATIBLE WITH US FIRMWARES (ALL have us firmware installed right now).
some of the model numbers are slightly different but you should see the x in the actual file downloaded.
IN FACT ALL CAMERAS seem to take the same firmware file.  Should verify with a DIFF though
Note the USB upgrade via the NVR takes a while for the cameras to reboot don't be worried.
